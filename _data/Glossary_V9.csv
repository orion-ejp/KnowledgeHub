Epidemiology,Animal Health,Attack Rate (AT),"Attack rates are actually risks (or ""incidence proportion"" or ""cumulative incidence""). Attack rates are often expressed as a percentage. An attack rate is not an incidence rate. It is actually a risk (also called incidence proportions), and the time contribution of each individual is not included in the denominator. The denominator consists of the number of individuals present at the beginning of the outbreak, disregarding those who will leave, develop illness, or die. This means that the cases (numerator) are also included in the denominator: it is therefor a true proportion. In outbreaks of short duration, attack rate is a term frequently used instead of risk or incidence proportion. In a foodborne outbreak, we will often refer to ""food specific attack rates"". In this circumstance, the denominator will consist of the number of individuals who ate a specific food, while the numerator will consists of the number of individuals who ate that food and became ill.",,Definition shared with public health.,,https://wiki.ecdc.europa.eu/fem/w/wiki/attack-rates-and-case-fatality,,,,Website,Attack rates and case fatality,Accessed on: 16.05.2019,,ECDC,,Adapted from ECDC field epidemiology manual wiki,32,"Do., Apr. 4 2019 11:37:38",

Risk assessment uses clinical, epidemiologic, toxicologic, environmental, and any other pertinent data. The process of determining risks to health attributable to environmental or other hazards. The process consists of four steps, as follows: 1) Hazard identification: Identifying the agent responsible for the health problem, its adverse effects, the target population, and the conditions of exposure. 2) Risk characterization: Describing the potential health effects of the hazard, quantifying dose-effect and dose-response relationships. 3) Exposure assessment: Quantifying exposure (dose) in a specified population based on measurement of emissions, environmental levels of toxic substances, biologic monitoring, etc. 4) Risk estimation: Combining risk characterization, dose-response relationships, and exposure estimates to quantify the risk level in a specific population. The end result is a qualitative and quantitative statement about the health effects expected and the proportion and number of affected people in a target population, including estimates of the uncertainties involved.

Type of study;,Shared Term,participatory surveillance,"Participatory surveillance explores traditional information networks by using participatory rural appraisal methods such as ranking, scoring and visualisation techniques to conduct risk-based, hazard-specific surveillance. The approach uses semi-structured interviews with key informants. This enables communities to provide their knowledge regarding health events, risks, impacts and control opportunities by gathering qualitative health data from defined populations. The analysis of participatory data emphasises the comparison of information obtained from multiple informants; the method uses a variety of techniques to obtain the most likely interpretation of events. The objective is to enhance sensitivity by identifying cases based on a clinical case definition; these may then be evaluated and confirmed using either rapid tests in the field or laboratory diagnostics. Conventional epidemiological investigation techniques can be used to evaluate and confirm outbreaks detected by participatory surveillance as part of trace-back and trace-forwards activities.",,,,https://www.fp7-risksur.eu/terminology/glossary,,,,RISKSUR,Animal Health Surveillance Terminology Final Report from Pre-ICAHS Workshop,2013,Risksur consortium,,,,549,"Do., Apr. 4 2019 11:37:59",16.04.2019 06:40:56

In such situations the source is said to be located 'at a single point in time and place'. These outbreaks have a typical bell shaped epidemic curve, that increases sharply, peaks and then decline sharply, which reflects the normal distribution of the incubation period of the causative agent in humans. For this reason, the epidemic curve of a point source outbreak can help us identify the moment of transmission (i.e. when all cases have been exposed to the source).",,,,https://wiki.ecdc.europa.eu/fem/w/wiki/types-of-outbreak,,,,Website,ECDC field epidemiology manual - Types of outbreak,2011,,ECDC,,,584,Wed Apr 17 2019 09:25:42 GMT+0200 (MESZ)_pointsourceoutbreak_SharedTerm_Shared Term,

 Sampling and Laboratory testing; Data processing and analysis;,Shared Term,Variant detection,"NGS is frequently used to identify mutations in DNA samples from individual patients or experimental organisms. Sequencing can be done at the whole-genome scale; RNA-seq, which targets expressed genes; exome capture, which targets specific exon regions captured by hybridization to probes of known sequence; or amplicons for genes or regions of interest. In all cases, sequence variants are detected by alignment of NGS reads to a reference sequence and then identification of differences between the reads and the reference. Variant detection algorithms must distinguish between random sequencing errors, differences caused by incorrect alignment, and true variants in the genome of the target organism. Various combinations of base quality scores, alignment quality scores, depth of coverage, variant allele frequency, and the presence of nearby sequence variants and indels are all used to differentiate true variants from false positives. Recent algorithms have also made use of machine learning methods based on training sets of genotype data or large sets of samples from different patients/organisms that are sequenced in parallel with the same sample preparation methods on the same NGS machines.",original definition,,,https://www.dnalinkseqlab.com/glossary/,,,,Website,Glossary of Sequencing Terms,Accessed on: 16.05.2019,,,,,920,Thu May 16 2019 10:33:06 GMT+0200 (Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit),
