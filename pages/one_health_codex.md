# WP1 - One Health Surveillance Codex

{{toc}}

This WP aims at the development of an integrated approach for a harmonized description and categorisation of surveillance data covering all surveillance phases. The primary focus will be on the development of the first “OH Surveillance Codex” document with harmonized descriptive guidelines. WP1 will also define requirements for data standards and software tools that should be developed to facilitate broad and easy adoption of the framework. These required supporting technical resources will be implemented by WP3. The OH pilot carried out by WP1 has the goal of demonstrating that the “OH Surveillance Codex” guidelines are practically applicable and generate the expected added value. It will also test and evaluate the supporting standards and tools developed by WP3. Based on the lessons learned from the OH pilot study this WP will make necessary adjustments to the “OH Surveillance Codex” document and provide feedback to the tool developers in WP3. Throughout the duration of the project WP1 will use workshops organized by WP4 to train other EJP projects and stakeholders and disseminate the “OH Surveillance Codex” and its underlying idea. WP1 will further support the development of the “Sustainability Roadmap” in WP4 to secure future development and adoption of the “OH Surveillance Codex” by EJP partners and European veterinary and public health agencies.
