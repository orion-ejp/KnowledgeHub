# About the ORION Project

The ORION project aims at establishing and strengthening inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in the area of surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One Health (OH) objective of improving health and wellbeing. This will be achieved through an interdisciplinary collaboration of 13 veterinary and/or public health institutes from 7 European countries. These agencies are committed to adopt best practice One Health Surveillance (OHS) solutions (guidelines, methods, tools and knowledge).  Specifically this project will create:

* an “OH Surveillance Codex” (WP1) – a high level framework for harmonised, cross-sectional description and categorisation of surveillance data covering all surveillance phases and all knowledge types.

* an “OHS Knowledge Hub” (WP2) – a cross-domain inventory of currently available data sources, methods / algorithms / tools, that support OH surveillance data generation, data analysis, modelling and decision support 

* “OHS Infrastructural Resources” (WP3) – that are practical, infrastructural resources forming the basis for successful harmonisation and integration of surveillance data and methods. 

Developed solutions will be exemplified and validated during several One Health pilot studies in which other EJP research projects may join in. These pilot studies will support the operationalisation and implementation of OH surveillance solutions on a national level and provide crucial feedback for future development and dissemination actions. An open web-based OHS Knowledge Hub will facilitate this knowledge exchange. Training and workshops will be offered to support and integrate with other EJP projects in their data harmonisation efforts.
