# WP3 - Infrastructural Harmonization Resources

WP3 will promote data interoperability (between med-vet-food fields, and also between countries) by building an ontology of health surveillance, and providing tools to integrate that ontology into the current data and information flows in surveillance practice. 
The goal is to respect current systems and practices, and integrate into the already existing flow of data management and reporting to international bodies (such as EFSA and ECDC). 

## WP3 resources

* [Animal Health Surveillance Ontology official website and resources](http://www.datadrivensurveillance.org/ontology) - visit this page to access the ontology and a tutorial on ontology use.
